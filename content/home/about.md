I’m associate professor of philosophy of science at the [Centre for Science Studies](https://css.au.dk/) at [Aarhus University](https://www.au.dk/) in Denmark.

My research in general philosophy of science focuses on the theory-evidence relationship, theory choice, prediction, explanation, and discovery. I use the history of science and other empirical methods to complement the philosophical toolbox. My book *[Theoretical Virtues in Science: Uncovering Reality Through Theory](https://samuelschindler.org/books/)* (CUP, 2018) is a culmination of that work.

I also have an interest in meta-philosophy both with regards to philosophy of science and other areas of philosophy. From 2016-2019, I was the PI of the research group on [Intuitions in Science and Philosophy](https://samuelschindler.org/project/), which focused on the (prima facie strange) practice of using intuitive judgements as evidence in both science and philosophy.

My PhD (in philosophy) is from the [University of Leeds](https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/philosophy) (2008). Prior to my appointment in Aarhus, I taught at the University of Birmingham (UK), and had research fellowships at the universities of Stockholm, Konstanz, and Pittsburgh (as fellow at [Centre for Philosophy of Science](https://www.centerphilsci.pitt.edu/)). I recently visited the Department of Philosophy at the UBC in Vancouver.
